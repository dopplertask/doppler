# doppler
Doppler is a revolutionary open-source software that allows you to automate tasks easily. Whether itâ€™s a bunch of bash scripts or just starting your car remotely, you can automate it. You can build, run, reuse and share automations with anyone around the globe.

On top of all of this life-simplifying project, we  are striving to make an climate friendly software that is fast, easy and consumes as little resources as possible.

## Usage

### Example
#### Add a task

Below is an example of a Dopplerfile:
```
{
  "name": "Test Task",
  "actions": [
    {
      "@type": "PrintAction",
      "message": "This is an example task."

#### Run a task


To run a task, send the JSON with the task id and parameters to the REST API:

```
{
  "automationId": 13,
  "parameters": {
  }
}
``` 

Example of the call:

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/schedule/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @run_task.json```
