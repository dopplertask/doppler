# doppler
Doppler is a revolutionary open-source software that allows you to easily automate tasks. Whether itâ€™s a bunch of bash scripts or just starting your car remotely, you can automate it. Build, run, reuse and share automations with anyone around the globe.

On top of all of this life-simplifying project, we are striving to make an climate friendly software that is fast, easy and consumes as little resources as possible.

## Build status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dopplertask/doppler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dopplertask/doppler)

## Simple install
Using snap:
