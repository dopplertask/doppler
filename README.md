# doppler
Doppler is a revolutionary open-source software that allows you to automate tasks easily. Whether itâ€™s a bunch of bash scripts or just starting your car remotely, you can automate it. You can build, run, reuse and share automations with anyone around the globe.

## Build status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dopplertask/doppler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dopplertask/doppler)

## Prerequisites

Install JDK 11 and gradle.

To run as a project:
```gradle clean build bootRun```

## Usage

### Example
#### Add a task

Below is an example of a Dopplerfile:
```
{
  "name": "Test Task",
  "actions": [
    {
      "actionType": "PrintAction",
      "fields": {
        "message": "This is an example task."
      }

#### Run a task


To run a task, send the JSON with the task id and parameters to the REST API:

```
{
  "automationId": 13,
  "parameters": {
  }
}
``` 

Example of the call:

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/schedule/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @run_task.json```
